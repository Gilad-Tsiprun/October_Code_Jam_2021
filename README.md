# International October Code Jam 2021 by Yandex Practicum 100.

The **International October Practicum Code Jam** aims to draw participants' attention to the challenges we face in a new reality and jointly come up with digital solutions to address them. Over the past 1,5 years, our daily lives have been profoundly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first shock of the crisis has passed but we are still adapting.

The challenge is to create an MVP of a digital service that we can benefit from as lockdowns,  travel regulations, changing workplace habits, and health precautions are still affecting our lives.
